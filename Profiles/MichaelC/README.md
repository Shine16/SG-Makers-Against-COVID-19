# MichaelC's Profiles

Here you can find my sample profile for PrusaSlicer, this is working great on my Ender 3 Pro, although your own mileage may vary.

## My Setup

My firmware is taken from here and customised for my defaults (probe offset, retraction, custom menu etc.) https://github.com/morningreis/Marlin-SKR-E3-Mini-1.2
